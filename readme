hi
it's 
read me please
there is nothing useful
yhis
this*
is just simple app for education purpuses
here we get data
then we parse it and clear from harmful data like null in names and last_names of users
in format of csv to sqlite on Python
In database we have 1 main table with list of users and their data also with time stamps
The time stamps are showing us the period of data being actual
In order to see changes over the unforgiving time
There is as table of temprory users(t_users) from this creates other 3 tables where the users are divided and waiting actions to changes
Updated, Deleted, New users
then they will go to the main table accordingly to changes
